        <p>
          I’m curious about how creators can build sustainable careers, how social media shapes identity, and how technology can make self-expression easier and more valuable. I’m currently exploring how product design and storytelling can help creators turn personal style into something shareable and scalable. Someone might follow my work because I’m building a creative app and sharing content that blends fashion, music, and lifestyle. My goal is to create tools and content that feel useful, aesthetic, and empowering.

      <p>
        I’m building a wardrobe + outfit planning app that helps people organize what they own and style outfits faster.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s designed for busy students and young professionals who want to look good without overthinking.
      </p>
      <p>
        It solves the daily “what should I wear?” problem by turning your wardrobe into an easy outfit system.
